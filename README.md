# Arduino-Alarm-System
A code designed on Arduino IDE that creates an alarm effect through PIR motion sensors. 
To run this program, you must connect the LEDs, PIR motion sensor, and speaker on the designated pins through an Arduino module, on a breadboard. You must also have the module pluged into the device when running the program so the code can be uploaded to the module.
